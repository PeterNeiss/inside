# `bnd::math` — reproducible math, one API, two engines

`bound/cmath.hpp` provides a `<cmath>`-shaped function set that operates on
`bound` values instead of `float`/`double`. There is **one public API** and
**two interchangeable engines**, selected at build time:

| Engine | Selected by | Reproducibility | constexpr | Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **double** (default) | — | bit-identical on every IEEE-754 binary64 platform compiled without `-ffast-math` (round-to-nearest) | no | ~2× faster |
| **integer / CORDIC** | CMake `-DBOUND_MATH_FIXED=ON` (macro `BND_MATH_FIXED`) | bit-identical **unconditionally** — any platform, any flags, no FPU required | yes | embedded-friendly |

> The double engine's "constexpr: no" lifts automatically on C++26 toolchains
> with constexpr `<cmath>` (P1383, `__cpp_lib_constexpr_cmath`) — the gate is
> already in place.

The double engine evaluates its own fixed polynomials (`std::fma` Horner,
hex-float coefficients, Cody-Waite range reduction) plus the correctly-rounded
`std::sqrt` — no `<cmath>` transcendentals anywhere. The integer engine runs
Q.30 fixed-point CORDIC/Newton cores. Both snap results onto the same
auto-deduced output grid, so the two engines are **feature- and
signature-identical**: the same source compiles against either.

> Engine = speed/representation; grid = precision. The result type and its
> grid-snapped value do not depend on the engine — only the internal
> arithmetic (and therefore the reproducibility contract and constexpr-ness)
> does.

```cpp
#include "bound/cmath.hpp"
using namespace bnd;

// Math operands carry the `real` policy (see below).
using angle = bound<{{-8, 8}, notch<1, 16384>}, round_nearest | real>;
auto s = math::sin(angle{1});       // amplitude bound in [-1, 1]
auto h = math::hypot(s, s);         // √(s²+s²), output grid auto-deduced
```

## The `real` policy requirement

Every transcendental operand must carry the **`real` representation flag**
(`bound<G, round_nearest | real>`); omitting it is a compile error. `real`
marks a bound as a math operand:

- Under the default engine it selects **double-backed storage** on the
  bound's grid — the raw *is* the value, so input marshalling into the
  engine is free (this is where the large speedup over integer-index I/O
  comes from). Values still obey the grid: they snap to the notch on store.
  Out-of-range stores run the same policy cascade as every other bound
  (clamp / wrap / sentinel / checked report).
- Under `BND_MATH_FIXED` the same flag is an ordinary `round_nearest`
  integer-backed bound — the source compiles unchanged.
- `real` requires a **dyadic grid** (power-of-two notch and Lower) so every
  grid point is exactly representable in `double` and the snap is lossless.
  A non-dyadic grid with `real` is a compile error.

Pure grid operations — `abs` / `floor` / `ceil` / `round` / `trunc` /
`fmod` — do **not** require `real`: they have no engine and act on any bound.

See [policies.md](policies.md#representation-flags) for `real` among the
other representation flags.

## Conventions

- **Angles are radians**, everywhere — `sin`/`cos`/`tan` take radians;
  `asin`/`acos`/`atan`/`atan2` return radians. (There is no turns-valued
  public API.)
- **Output grids are auto-deduced.** Calling `f(x)` with no explicit template
  argument deduces the result `bound` from the input's interval and notch:
  the interval is the function's true range over the input, rounded *outward*
  to the input's notch; the notch and policy are inherited (with
  `round_nearest` added, since transcendental results carry sub-notch drift).
  Spell `f<Out>(x)` to pick the output grid yourself.
- **Error model.** A domain limit that is knowable from the *type* is a
  `static_assert` (compile error). A failure that depends on the *runtime
  value* is reported through `slim::expected<Out, errc>`. Total functions
  return the bound directly. When an explicit `Out` carries `clamp`, a
  result that merely leaves `Out`'s interval **saturates** instead of
  erroring (poles and domain errors still error).
- **Precision.**
  - *Double engine:* the cores are accurate to ~1 ULP of `double`, then the
    result is quantized onto the output grid — so the stored value is within
    one notch of the true value.
  - *Integer engine:* the transcendental cores run in Q.30 fixed point
    (~1e-6–1e-9 depending on composition depth), then quantize onto the
    output grid.
  - Algebraically-exact results (e.g. `cbrt(8)`, `hypot(3,4)`, `pow(2,10)`)
    land exactly under both engines.
- **Input-range limits** below are engine-shared `static_assert` envelopes,
  kept identical for both engines so the same programs compile everywhere.
  The trig/root/atan limits (±2^20) come from the integer engine's working
  scale; the `exp`/`exp2`/`pow` limits are **output representability** —
  e.g. e^44's exact numerator exceeds any grid's integer range — and cannot
  widen without coupling them to the output grid.
- **constexpr.** The math functions are `constexpr` only under
  `BND_MATH_FIXED` (the double engine's `std::fma`/`std::sqrt` are runtime).
  The compile-time output-grid deduction uses the integer cores in **both**
  builds, so grids and types never depend on the engine.

## Algebraic tier (exact, no polynomials, no `real` needed)

| Function | Domain | Output | Errors | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `abs(x)` | all | `[0, max\|·\|]` | — | exact |
| `floor(x)` / `ceil(x)` / `round(x)` / `trunc(x)` | all | integer notch | — | exact; `round` is half-away-from-zero |
| `fmod(x, y)` | `y` must not span 0 | sign of `x` | — | truncated-division convention, exact. Integer-backed operands on commensurable notches take a single-integer-remainder fast path (faster than `std::fmod`). |
| `pown<E>(x)` | all, `E ≥ 0` compile-time | corner-widened per multiply | optional per the checked-exact rules | repeated squaring in bound-space — exact, negative bases fine, no `real` needed |

## Roots

| Function | Domain | Output | Errors | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sqrt(x)` (`Lower == 0`) | `[0, 4]`, notch `1/2^K`, `K ≤ 30` | `[0, ≈√Upper]` | — | correctly-rounded core, grid-snapped |
| `sqrt(x)` (`Lower < 0`) | `max\|·\| ≤ 4`, notch `1/2^K` | — | `expected`; `domain_error` if value < 0 | mixed-sign overload |
| `cbrt(x)` | `\|x\| ≤ 2^20` | monotone range | — | `sign(x)·2^(log2\|x\|/3)` |
| `hypot(x, y)` | `\|x\|,\|y\| ≤ 2^20` | `[0, √(maxX²+maxY²)]` | — | no internal overflow inside the domain |

## Trigonometric (radians)

| Function | Domain | Output | Errors | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sin(x)` / `cos(x)` | `\|x\| ≤ 2^20` rad | `[-1, 1]` | — | grids beyond ±1024 rad use a two-term 1/2π reduction (fixed engine) |
| `tan(x)` | `\|x\| ≤ 2^20` rad | `[-1024, 1024]` | `expected`; `division_by_zero` at a pole, `overflow` past `Out` (saturates instead when `Out` carries `clamp`) | sin/cos ratio |
| `atan(x)` | `\|x\| ≤ 2^20` | `(-π/2, π/2)` | — | reciprocal reduction for \|x\| > 1 |
| `asin(x)` | `[-1, 1]` | `[-π/2, π/2]` | — | `atan2(x, √(1-x²))` |
| `acos(x)` | `[-1, 1]` | `[0, π]` | — | `π/2 - asin(x)` |
| `atan2(y, x)` | `\|y\|,\|x\| ≤ 2^20` | `[-π, π]` | — | quadrant-correct; normalized by max magnitude internally |

## Hyperbolic

| Function | Domain | Output | Errors | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sinh(x)` / `cosh(x)` / `tanh(x)` | `[-10, 10]` | monotone (cosh: even, min 1) | — | from `e^x` via the exp core |

## Exponential & logarithmic

| Function | Domain | Output | Errors | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exp(x)` / `exp2(x)` | `exp`: `[-20, 20]`, `exp2`: `[-30, 30]` | `≥ 0` | — | `exp = exp2(x·log2 e)` |
| `log(x)` / `log2(x)` / `log10(x)` | `x > 0` | monotone | — | |
| `pow_base<B>(x)` | integer `B ≥ 2` | `≥ 0` | — | `exp2(x·log2 B)`, `B` compile-time |
| `pow(base, exp)` | `Lower<base> > 0` | corner-deduced | `expected`; `overflow` if `exp·log2 base` leaves `[-30,30]` or result leaves `Out` | runtime base |

## Constants

`math::pi` and `math::two_pi` are point-bounds (`just<…>`), so they compose
directly in bound-space: `angle * math::two_pi`.

## Using `expected` results

```cpp
auto t = math::tan(angle{1});          // expected<bound, errc>
if (t) use(*t);
else if (t.error() == errc::division_by_zero) /* at a pole */;

auto r = math::sqrt(signed_in{v});     // mixed-sign → expected
auto p = math::pow(base, exponent);    // expected
```

Expected results compose with arithmetic directly — the chain stays an
`expected` and the first error wins:

```cpp
auto r = math::sqrt(signed_in{v}) * gain + offset;   // expected<bound, errc>
```

To drop the cause and enter the zero-cost `optional` chaining world instead,
convert with `bnd::ok(...)`:

```cpp
auto o = ok(math::tan(angle{x})) * gain;             // optional<bound>
```

See [arithmetic.md](arithmetic.md) for the bridge rules (error precedence,
the no-mixing compile error) and
[internals.md](internals.md#7-error-vocabulary) for the full error
vocabulary.

## Selecting the integer engine

```bash
cmake -B build-fixed -DBOUND_CXX20=ON -DBOUND_MATH_FIXED=ON
cmake --build build-fixed
```

Use it when you need bit-identical results across heterogeneous targets
(e.g. an x86 host and a soft-float embedded core), `constexpr` math, or an
FPU-free build. The default double engine is the right choice everywhere
else: it carries the same grid guarantees and is reproducible across IEEE-754
platforms compiled without `-ffast-math`.
